## 💻 Projects

# 🛡️ HOMELAB SOC ENVIRONMENT & ATTACK SIMULATION PLATFORM
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/View_on_GitHub-181717?style=flat-square&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/EzlikDragon/ndmontederamos-HOMELAB)


A **self-contained Security Operations Center (SOC) lab environment** designed for security monitoring, threat detection, and hands-on attack simulation.  
This platform mirrors real-world enterprise SOC workflows by combining **defensive monitoring infrastructure** with an **isolated attack network** for controlled adversary simulation.

🚀 Project Goal

This homelab is designed to simulate real SOC operations, not just demonstrate tools.
Every log, alert, and attack path exists to sharpen detection, response, and analysis skills aligned with real-world security roles.

---

## 🎯 Architecture Objective

This lab is built as a **dual-network virtual environment**:

### 🔵 Monitoring Network (192.168.10.0/24)
- Windows Server 2022 – Active Directory Domain Services
- Windows 10 Enterprise – Endpoint telemetry & logging
- Ubuntu Server – Splunk Enterprise SIEM

### 🔴 Attack Network (Isolated Segment)
- Kali Linux – Penetration testing and attack simulation

Strict network separation ensures **realistic attack paths** while maintaining **safe containment**.

**Overview**: Conducted a hands-on security investigation using Splunk SIEM to analyze a simulated cyber attack in a TryHackMe lab environment. **Successfully identified and tracked attacker "a1berto" across 12,256 logs, uncovering 8 unique IOCs and reconstructing the complete attack chain in under 20 minutes.** This project demonstrates practical incident response skills and the ability to transform raw log data into actionable security intelligence.

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ **Rapid Triage**: Identified initial compromise in <2 minutes
- ✅ **Complete Attack Chain**: Reconstructed full attack timeline in ~10 minutes
- ✅ **IOC Extraction**: Discovered 8 unique indicators of compromise
- ✅ **Cross-Source Correlation**: Analyzed 5 different log source types

## 📊 Investigation Timeline
| Time Frame | Phase | Activities | Deliverables |
|------------|-------|------------|--------------|
| **< 2 minutes** | **Initial Detection** | - First query execution (`EventID=4720`)<br>- Immediate identification of backdoor user "A1berto" | - Compromise confirmed<br>- Initial IOC identified |
| **~10 minutes** | **Attack Chain Reconstruction** | - Registry analysis (`EventID=13`)<br>- User impersonation investigation<br>- PowerShell activity correlation<br>- Lateral movement tracking | - Complete attack timeline<br>- All IOCs extracted<br>- Attack pattern identified |
| **15-25 minutes** | **Complete Investigation** | - Base64 payload decoding<br>- C2 server identification<br>- Final correlation of all evidence<br>- Documentation and reporting | - Comprehensive investigation report<br>- 8 unique IOCs documented<br>- MITRE ATT&CK mapping completed |

### Detection Lab
A home SOC lab environment for practicing threat detection, log analysis, and incident response using open-source security tools.

### SOC Automation Project
Developing automation scripts for common SOC tasks including log parsing, alert triage, and IOC (Indicator of Compromise) checking.

### TryHackMe Write-ups
Documenting solutions and methodologies for various TryHackMe rooms focusing on defensive security techniques.
